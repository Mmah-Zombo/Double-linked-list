# HISTORY

I created this program a day after watching a youtube tutorial on singly linked lists. I just decided to give it a try by myself, no chatGPT3 or google, just me  and surprisingly I succeeded. I only checked on how to declare an array from a C textbook [it's funny that I can remeber the complex stuffs and not remember simplr array creation 😅]. I felt super super smart after getting the program to work in a couple of hours.

# How the program works

⭐ First a dounle linked list with two nodes is created and traversed (using the tracker pointer), printing the elements at each node encountered along the way.

⭐Then two more nodes are created and added to the list. The new list is traversed backwards and each element is printed in this proces. 

⭐Next, I made a visual represent of the link in the terminal, to prove that it is a double link list. Oberve the output to see how the nodes are pointing to each other.

⭐The commented codes are funtional, I excluded them from the program to reduce the ouput on the terminal. The complex syntax used in these printf functions were figured out by my intution, I just thought "Hey if this works in singly linked list, then adding some more juice to it and applying it to double linked list will work", and it did! 


🥰🥰🥰 Thank you for checking out my code. Kindly give it a star if you like what you see. ❤💝
