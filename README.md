# HISTORY

I created this program a day after watching a youtube tutorial on singly linked lists. I just decided to give double linked lists a try by myself, no chatGPT3 or google, just me, and surprisingly I succeeded. I only checked out how to declare an array from a C textbook [it's funny that I can remember the complex stuffs and not remember simple array creation 😅]. I felt super super smart after getting the program to work in a couple of hours.

# How the program works

⭐ First two nodes are created and joined together as a double linked list, after this, the list is traversed (using the tracker pointer), printing the elements at each node encountered along the way.

⭐Then two more nodes are created and added to the list. The new list is traversed backwards and each element is printed in this process. 

⭐Next, I made a visual representation of the link in the terminal to prove that it is a double link list. Observe the output to see how the nodes are pointing to each other. And check the code to validate the results.

⭐The commented codes are funtional, I excluded them from the program to reduce the ouput on the terminal. The complex syntax used in these printf functions were figured out by my intuition, I just thought "Hey, if this works in singly linked list, then adding some more juice to it and applying it to double linked list, will work", and it did!
